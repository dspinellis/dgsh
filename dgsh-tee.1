.SH NAME
dgsh-tee \- buffer and copy or scatter standard input to one or more sinks
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdgsh-tee\fP
[\fB\-b\fP \fIbuffer-size\fP]
[\fB\-afIMs\fP]
[\fB\-i\fP \fIinput-file\fP]
[\fB\-o\fP \fIoutput-file\fP]
[\fB\-m\fP \fImemory-size\fP]
[\fB\-p\fP \fIo1,o2 ...\fP]
[\fB\-T\fP \fIdirectory\fP]
[\fB\-t\fP \fIcharacter\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdgsh-tee\fP will read data from its standard input and scatter it to
the specified sinks as files.
It resembles in its operation \fItee\fP(1),
but offers additional capabilities required for the operation of \fIdgsh\fP(1).
In contrast to \fItee\fP(1), \fIdgsh-tee\fP will buffer the data it handles,
so it will never cause deadlock or starvation when one or more sinks
are unable to read data.
.PP
\fIdgsh-tee\fP is normally executed from within \fIdgsh\fP-generated scripts,
rather than through end-user commands.
This manual page serves mainly to document its operation,
to clarify the flags that can be used at the beginning of an \fIdgsh\fP scatter block, and
to allow the creation of plug-compatible replacements
implementing different record types.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-a\fP
Open files subsequently specified with the \fB-o\fP option for appending.

.IP "\fB\-b\fP \fIbuffer-size\fP"
Specify the size of the buffer to use.
This is by default 1MB.
Buffers are chained together when more space is required,
so the main utility of this option is to decrease the buffer
size in memory-constrained environments.
The specified number can be suffixed with
\fBk\fI, \fBM\fI, or \fBG\fI to specify the corresponding unit.
The specified buffer size must be less than the program's maximum memory size.

.IP "\fB\-f\fP
When the allocated memory size reaches the maximum memory threshold,
start using a temporary file for buffering the data.
This extends the amount of data that can be buffered to the
space available on disk.
The location of the temporary file follows the
\fItempnam\fP(3) rules, and can be overridden through the
.B -T
option.

.IP "\fB\-I\fP"
Implement input-side buffering.
By default \fIdgsh-tee\fP will buffer only as much input data,
as is needed to avoid starving one of the specified sinks.
In doing so it may cause its input source to block
while having data to write.
When this option is enabled
\fIdgsh-tee\fP will always read data if they are available
on the standard input,
and will write that data to any (including zero) sinks that
can read it.
This can be useful in cases where a command with insufficient input
buffering,
like \fIjoin\fP(1), \fIsort\fP(1), or \fIpaste\fP(1),
is gathering input from commands executing in parallel.
In such a case adding \fIdgsh-tee\fP with input side buffering
enabled at the end of each data pipeline,
will increase the number of processes that can operate concurrently.

.IP "\fB\-i\fP \fIinput-file\fP"
Read input from the specified source file, rather than the standard input.
The option can be provided multiple times to specify multiple files that
will be read sequentially.
All input files will be opened at the beginning of the program's operation
in order to unblock the execution of asynchronous shell commands
that redirect their output to the corresponding named pipes.
Furthermore, when input-side buffering is specified \fB-I\fP
data is read asynchronously from all specified input files.

.IP "\fB\-M\fP"
Provide memory use statistics on termination.
This is mainly used for testing,
to check against leaks of buffers.

.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIoutput-file\fP"
Write copies of the input data to the specified sink file,
rather than the standard output.
The option can be provided multiple times to specify multiple files
where input data will be copied.

.IP "\fB\-m\fP \fImemory-size\fP"
Specify the maximum size of memory to allocate for buffers.
This is by default 256MB.
When \fIdgsh-tee\fP exhausts this memory, it enters a state where it
waits for its output buffers drain, thus freeing allocated memory.
The specified number can be suffixed with
\fBk\fI, \fBM\fI, or \fBG\fI to specify the corresponding unit.
The specified maximum memory size must be larger than the program's buffer size.

.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fIo1,o2 ...\fP"
Permute the inputs to the specified outputs.
The comma-separated arguments \fIo1,o2, ...\fP
specify the number of the output channel (starting from 1)
where the corresponding \fIn\fPth input channel will be sent.
Thus,
input 1 goes to output \fIo1\fP,
input 2 goes to output \fIo2\fP,
and so on.
As an example a cross-permutation is specified with the argument \fI-p 2,1\fP.

.IP "\fB\-s\fP"
Scatter the input fairly across the sinks, rather than copying it to all.
When this option is in effect,
the input data are divided into chunks of one or more lines,
and each chunk is written only to a single sink.
This is useful for dividing the work among multiple processes operating
in parallel.

.IP "\fB\-T\fP \fIdirectory\fP"
Specify the directory to use for storing the temporary file,
when the specified maximum buffer memory size is exceeded.

.IP "\fB\-t\fP \fIchar\fP"
Use \fIchar\fP as the record separator,
By default the record separator is a newline,
An empty (not missing) argument for the record separator
will make the record separator be the null character.
