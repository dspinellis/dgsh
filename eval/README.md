The evaluation method for the classic shell performance is based
on an earlier version of *dgsh*, *sgsh*,
which can translate its input into plain shell scripts.
To measure the classic shell performance, checkout a release containing *sgsh*,
such as `46b1aec`, run `make`, and then run the baseline measurements.
